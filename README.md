# ExoplanetEDA
## An Exploratory Data Analysis about Exoplanets

The goal of this project is to emphasize on the importance of obtaining raw data to later infer valuable insights from it. It is focused on the laborious work of searching for the best data that can solve the problem (for demonstration purposes I'm just going to do the EDA, but in a real-world scenario these data could be used, for example, to feed a ML or DL algorithm).

Tools and Technologies: NASA's Open API Exoplanet, Python, Google Colab, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
