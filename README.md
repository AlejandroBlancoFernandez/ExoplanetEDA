# An Exploratory Data Analysis about Exoplanets

The initial premise of this project is to understand a little bit more about exoplanets, which basically are planets that lay far beyond our Solar System and that orbit other stars. The programming goal is to emphasize on the importance of obtaining raw data to later infer valuable insights from it. It is focused on the laborious work of searching for the best data that can solve the problem. For demonstration purposes, I'm just going to do the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), but in a real-world scenario, these data could be used, for example, to feed a ML or DL algorithm.

**Tools and Technologies**: NASA's Open API Exoplanet, Python, Google Colab, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Project Development (steps)

### 1. Gathering the data

My source for obtaining the data is [NASA's Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html) databse.
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Once the data is gathered
